# Advent of Code
A repository containing all my Advent of Code solutions for this and previous years.

## Input
I have included input text files for my account. Note that your input is different, so while these
allow you to run and test the code, they do not give you the correct answer.

## Common library
I use a self-made library (stored in the aoc directory) to do common tasks for me, such as reading input files
and running challenge entrypoint functions (adds nice formatting to the output).
